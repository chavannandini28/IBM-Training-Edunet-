# 📱 SMS Spam Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview

This project implements an *SMS Spam Detection System* using Machine Learning techniques.
The goal is to automatically classify SMS messages as *Spam* or *Ham (Not Spam)* based on their textual content.

Such a system is crucial in preventing fraudulent, advertising, and malicious messages from reaching users.

---

## 🚀 Features

* Preprocessing of SMS text (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).
* Feature extraction using *TF-IDF / Bag of Words*.
* Model training using ML algorithms:

  * Naive Bayes
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  * Random Forest
* Evaluation with *accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score*.
* Predict function to classify new SMS messages.

## 🗂️ Dataset

We used the *SMS Spam Collection Dataset* available from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/sms+spam+collection).

* Total messages: *5574*
* Labels:

  * ham → legitimate message
  * spam → unwanted message

## 🔑 Methodology

1. *Data Cleaning & Preprocessing*

   * Removed punctuation, stopwords, and converted text to lowercase.
   * Tokenization and stemming applied.

2. *Feature Engineering*

   * Converted SMS text into numerical vectors using *TF-IDF Vectorizer*.

3. *Model Training*

   * Applied multiple algorithms (Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
   * Tuned hyperparameters for better performance.

4. *Evaluation*

   * Compared models using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.

---

## 📈 Results & Analysis

* *Naive Bayes* performed best for spam detection with high recall.
* Example evaluation:

  * Accuracy: *97%*
  * Precision: *96%*
  * Recall: *95%*
  * F1-Score: *95.5%*
